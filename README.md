Implements new alerts for train statuses mentioned in the Factorio Friday Facts #395. Trains will now alert if there's no path, instead of showing red text popup. And now there would be an icon over the train if destination is full, if alt mode is enabled.

There is also configuration for showing the No path alert on the map and hiding the Destination full icon behind alt mode.
Currently the mod is fully translated only to English (en), Ukrainian (uk) and German (de).
